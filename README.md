# Godot 4 Template Project

This is a simple Godot 4 template project that you can download and use freely just to have simple things set up and ready to go.

## This project contains:
- Commonly used folders
  - `dev` subfolders
  - colors
- [Passivestar's minimal editor theme](https://github.com/passivestar/godot-minimal-theme?tab=MIT-1-ov-file) pre-applied

There are no `model`, `textures` or `sprites` subfolders in the `assets` folder and no scripts because I made this with both 2D and 3D in mind.

### Enjoy
